Motivation 

We were inspired to undertake this project as we are both active investors. With the current state of the market, we were left wishing that we had better managed our portfolios so that we could have made less losses. 


Aim 

We hope to develop a web-based portfolio management system that helps users track and optimise their investments. At the same time, we aim to gain practical experience in web development, data integration and machine learning.

How we are different from existing platforms
Description
BeavantBrokers is your all-in-one web app for effortless, data-driven investing. Built with React on the front end and Node.js/Express on the back end, it leverages Socket.IO for real-time price streaming and a Python-powered ML microservice for short-term forecasts. Integrated with the Yahoo Finance API, BeavantBrokers lets you:
Dashboard: See your portfolio’s total value, P&L, and risk metrics at a glance.


Watchlist: Add symbols you care about and view live + historical charts side by side.


ML Forecasts: Get buy/sell/hold predictions with confidence intervals, updated automatically.


Custom Alerts: Define price thresholds and get instant notifications 


Beginner-Friendly Onboarding: Follow a step-by-step setup wizard, explore contextual tooltips, and start with a pre-populated “Starter Portfolio” to learn as you go.


Portfolio Analysis Tool: Discover insights on your portfolio at the click of a button. Useful for both beginner and seasoned investors. 
Need
Most investment tools either offer basic tracking (e.g. static charts) or generic alerts, and only a handful dabble in AI-driven insights, but none seamlessly blend live data, machine learning, and onboarding for newcomers. BeavantBrokers fills this gap by:
Unified Experience


Combines live streaming, portfolio analytics, and AI forecasts in one interface.


Actionable Intelligence


Transforms raw price data into clear recommendations, complete with confidence levels.
Delivers insightful and actionable analysis on any portfolio.


Habit-Building Tools


Smart reminders and milestone badges help you check in regularly and reinforce good investing practices.


Designed for Beginners


Interactive tutorials guide you through every feature.


Simplified visuals and a “Starter Portfolio” of blue-chip stocks get you investing in minutes with no jargon required.


By integrating these elements, BeavantBrokers empowers both first-time investors and seasoned traders to make smarter decisions and build healthy market habits right from the browser.

Project Log


App Demo Walkthrough
Sign up & Log in 


This is our log in page for users to both register themselves if they are new, or if they have an existing account they can proceed to login. There is an option where users can reset their password if they have forgotten them. 

Registering 

This is an example of a user registering for their account 
Successful Registration


A successful registration will look like this, notifying the users about it and getting them to click a link in their email to verify their account prior to login.
Registering with an existing email 

This is what registering with an existing email will look like, notifying the users about it.
Forgot your password?

This is what users will see when they click on the “forgot password?” button, allowing them to enter the email address of their account to reset their password. 

Password Reset Email

This is an example of the email users will receive to reset the password of their account.
Reset Password

Users are able to key in their new desired password. 
Successful Resetting of Password


After clicking on the “reset password” button, users will see this, indicating a successful reset. 
Successful Log-in & Homepage

If the user has entered the correct email and password for their account, they will automatically be redirected to the dashboard page. 


Dashboard

This is a streamlined portfolio overview where users will see their Total Value, Today’s P&L and Unrealized Gains/Losses. 


 
Market Watchlist



This is the market watchlist section where users can enter their desired tickers to monitor, showing them the real time pricing and key metrics as well as a button to show the historical data for the ticker on the 1D, 1W, 1M and 1Y ranges. 



Hovering over a key metric shows the user a tooltip about what the metric indicates. 
ML Predictions

This is the stock predictions section where users are able to view the predicted price of their stocks in the future based on a machine learning model. 
My Profile


This is the My profile section where users are able to add or remove positions as you trade. It will generate your total portfolio position and calculate your profit or loss based on the current stock prices. 
Alerts

This is the Alerts section where users are able to customize alerts on any ticker they wish. Alerts are displayed in a table format, and will trigger a desktop notification when the condition is met and disappear from the table. 

This is what it looks like when desktop notifications are blocked.

Challenges Faced:

ID
Challenges
Explanation and Actions taken
1
Missing Frontend Navigation
 
When building the web UI for BeavantBrokers, I discovered that the buttons to toggle between Dashboard, Watchlist, Predictions, Profile, and Logout simply were not rendering. After tracing through the React component tree, I realised I forgot to include the <NavLink> elements in the header layout and have not wired up the router. Adding those links into App.js and adjusting the CSS to position them properly fixed the issue and taught me to always verify that my navigation elements are present before moving on.


2
Yahoo-Finance dependency not found
While integrating the Yahoo Finance API for live price data, the server crashed with “Cannot find module yahoo-finance.” It turned out I installed the package locally but never committed it to package.json, so any fresh clone wouldn’t pull it in. The solution was to update our Continuous Integration steps to run npm install automatically on each deploy.
3
Weekend Bars for stock prices
When we initially generated the stock graphs, there were straight lines every week, which we quickly realised was the result of the market being closed on the weekend. We fixed this by changing the graphs to a categorical instead of date based and not plotting the weekend data. 
4
Visual appearance of graph
When we first load the watchlist graphs, it slowly expands and we have to wait until it fully expands before it can load the price graph. We tried fixing this for some time, but decided to leave it to a later date until we have more time. 
5
API limitations
Due to limitations in the number of calls per minute on polygon API, some functions such as the watchlist are limited on the number of tickers it can display metrics for. 
6
Invalid JSON responses
Instead of JSON, some /predict calls returned HTML (an error page), which our front end could  not parse, so we added proper error handling and ensured the API always returned valid JSON.
7
Memory exhaustion
Training a separate TensorFlow model for each ticker consumed too much GPU/RAM. We had to pivot to a unified model handling multiple symbols to fit within hardware limits with lesser tickers. Even running the model on render will exhaust its memory at times due to a limitation on render’s free plan, giving a “Ran out of memory (used over 512MB) while running your code.” error. Resulting in a need for users to try again to receive their predictions. 




Unit Testing

To verify that all our features and software as a whole works as expected, we carried out a series of tests on our features, with the test cases and steps documented below. Whenever a test case failed, we debugged and rectified the issues. The relevant test cases for each feature were carried out in isolation whenever we made changes to the respective features.
