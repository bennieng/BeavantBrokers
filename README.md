Orbital 25 - BeavantBrokers
Milestone I for Orbital 25

Team Name: 

BeavantBrokers 

Proposed Level of Achievement: 

Apollo 11

Motivation 

We were inspired to undertake this project as we are both active investors. With the current state of the market, we were left wishing that we had better managed our portfolios so that we could have made less losses. 

Aim 

We hope to develop a web-based portfolio management system that helps users track and optimize their investments. At the same time, we aim to gain practical experience in web development, data integration and machine learning. 

User Stories

As a casual stock investor who wants to see my total portfolio value and performance trends over different timeframes (1D, 1W, 1M, 1Y), I want to be able to take stock of my portfolio easily and clearly with a glance, as well as set goals and strategies within the web app. 
I want to be able to receive notifications when stock prices move out of boundaries I have set, and have the web app keep me accountable on my strategies. 
I want to follow actionable suggestions to optimise returns and reduce risk to better manage my portfolio. 


Feature 1 (core): Comprehensive and clear portfolio overview
A dashboard that consist of all of a user’s position that they are able to view at one glance
Stocks, cash and other assets breakdown
Overall P&L
Risk status
Feature 2 (core): Real-time monitoring of stock prices
Live price feed for tickets in the user’s watchlist or portfolio, 
Prices updating every few seconds without the need for a full page reload 
Charts depicting these changes updated as well 
Feature 3 (core): ML model to attempt to predict stock prices (2 features cause its complex) (end)
ML model that generates short-term forecasts of selected stock prices and their confidence intervals 
Feature 4 (extension): Suggested strategies for stock holdings (end)
Based on the user’s respective portfolio composition and forecasted movements, the system will recommend buy/ sell/ hold strategies
Feature 5 (extension): Notifications and alerts for user-determined events 
Allow users to have customisable triggers based on price threshold, % changes and news sentiment that will send a notification when the conditions are met 

Timeline

Qualifications

Intermediate knowledge in backend development and machine learning. Proficient in relational databases and well-versed in building responsive web pages. 
Intermediate understanding of how to conduct data analysis and predictive analytics. 
Previously coded a telegram bot. 
CS2030, CS1010
CS50x (Online with harvard)

Software Engineering
Agile Development
To break down development process into manageable tasks
Weekly meetings to keep on track
Git and GitHub
For version control, and easy rollback when necessary
Test-Driven Development
We will try using TDD for all features, where we will write unit tests to validate expected behaviour, and write code to pass these tests. 
Modular and scalable architecture
We will design the web app with modular architecture in mind, dividing development into components. This will make the system scalable and easier to maintain. 
Database Normalisation
We will use a relational database to store data. We will apply what we have learnt from BT2102 to design a normalised schema for more efficient querying. 
Performance optimisation
Considering the vast amounts of data we will have to deal with, performance is a key consideration. As such, we will focus on optimising backend queries for speed, and implement lazy loading and code splitting for the frontend.
